So let's start with the beginning and that's the reason why many people have been coming to internshala !! How did I get the internship?
Well I was trying for some foreign internship(you know the reason why ;)). But as I started late,internships being offered there were without much money to cover the expenses!! :/
Finally I decided to try my hands at something off beat-Management internship.The professor was very nice and sweet from the very first mail.The conversation followed and I somehow got to reach IIM Bangalore.Even I got a friend of mine ;) to get a similar internship @IIMB(afterall the campus was too far from the city and I wanted someone to roam alongwith.)
The awesomeness began from the very first day of my internship!! My research advisor texted me for the first meeting and we went for lunch the very next day.The best part was that even she didn't knew what work should she assign to me,but I realized from the very first day that she was really sweet and fun to talk to.I somehow(luckily) never had to interact as a research assistant with her.Throughout the entire process of  brainstorming sessions,study design and implementation,it was always equal participation from both of us.
The best part was that she somehow arranged a room in the hostel(it's officially not allowed for interns to stay in the campus after a specific period of time). Now I can go in for the meeting at 5 mintute notices.The workload however was low.Actually after all the brainstorming already being done,it was easy for me to get the things implemented.
Ohh..did I tell you about the campus?WE
